exp003,Noor and Jordan,4/18/19,First test of iGEM plasmids and updated plate reader protocol,4/16/16,Strains were started from freezer stocks instead of colonies on the day before. Used completely clear 96-well plate instead of black clear bottom. LB was hurriedly warmed in water bath instead of in incubator.,T,T,
exp004,Ginny and Diya,4/24/19,Second test of iGEM plasmids from exp003 with updated plate reader protocol,4/16/19,Identical to exp003 except strain well positions were shifted and LB was warmed in the 37 degree fridge 3 hours prior to plating. Strains BB82 and BB83 were accidentally unincluded. Failed because read stationary.,F,F,
exp005,Ginny,4/30/19,Third test of iGEM plasmids from exp003 with updated SOP.,4/18/19,Strains were started from freezer stocks and locations of strains were shifted in plate wells relative to exp003.,T,T,
